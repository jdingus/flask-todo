1. Flask Framework: All the Python files (app.py, db.py, models.py, views.py) will import and use the Flask framework for building the application.

2. Sqlite Database: The db.py and models.py files will interact with the Sqlite database. The db.py file will handle the database connection and operations, while the models.py file will define the data schema for the TODO items.

3. Bootstrap: The HTML files (index.html, create.html, update.html, delete.html) will use Bootstrap for the UI. The CSS and JS files (bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.min.js) are part of the Bootstrap framework and will be used across all HTML files.

4. Shared Variables: The app.py file will likely define the Flask app instance which will be imported and used in the views.py file. The db.py file will define the database instance which will be imported and used in the models.py and views.py files.

5. Data Schema: The models.py file will define the data schema for the TODO items, which will be used in the views.py file for CRUD operations.

6. DOM Elements: The HTML files will likely share some common DOM elements such as a navigation bar, footer, etc. The IDs of these elements will be used in the bootstrap.min.js file for any required JavaScript functionality.

7. Function Names: The views.py file will define the functions for handling the routes of the application. These function names will be used in the app.py file to map the routes to their respective functions.

8. Message Names: Any flash messages used for user notifications will be defined in the views.py file and used in the HTML files to display the messages to the user.
