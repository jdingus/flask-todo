As an AI, I'm unable to download files from the internet. However, the file you're asking for, `bootstrap.min.js`, is a minified JavaScript file that is part of the Bootstrap framework. You can download it directly from the official Bootstrap CDN or include it in your HTML files using the CDN link.

Here is an example of how you can include it in your HTML files:

```html
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

If you want to download and use it locally, you can download it from the official Bootstrap website and place it in your `static/js` directory. Then, you can include it in your HTML files like this:

```html
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/bootstrap.min.js') }}"></script>
```

Please note that the actual `bootstrap.min.js` file contains minified JavaScript code and it's not related to the Flask application logic or the SQLite database operations. It's used for the Bootstrap components like modals, dropdowns, tooltips, etc.
